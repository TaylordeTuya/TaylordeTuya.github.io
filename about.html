          <h1>Hello!</h1>
            <p>I'm Taylor de Tuya, a student at the University of Miami in the School of Communication. I am majoring in Public Relations and minoring in both marketing and music. I expect to graduate this fall with a bachelors degree.</p>
            <p>I was born and raised in Miami, Florida. As a Miami native I have been exposed to dozens of different cultures and people. Growing up in Miami has taught me how to relate to and communicate with people who have completely different ideas, customs, and beliefs than I do. I love to work with and help people on a daily basis. I hope to use my experience and dedication to achieve success in the field of public relations and to contribute my absolute best to society.</p>
            <p>Please visit <a href="http://taylordetuya.me/resume.html">MY RESUME</a>  for more information on my experience, education, and skills. You may also take a peek at some of my design projects and public relations writing samples here on my site.</p>
